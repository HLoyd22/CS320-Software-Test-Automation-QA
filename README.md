How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
---------------------------------------------------------

I can ensure that my code, program or the software is functional and secure by testing. This will make sure that the code that is being written is functional. While
this projected only used white box testing there are many other forms. For white box testing, the goal of this is to traverse all statements at least once and 
find any faults within the code that might exist. This type of technique is focused on how the code structure, data structure and internal design works and test accordingly. So for this project this is how this was accomplished. I can take this tool set and apply it to other programs in the future.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
---------------------------------------------------------

In all programs user needs are very important. There were requiments that were given to us by the user. To meet these needs we implement the white box testing like
mentioned above. If I do not meet the requirments that were listed then this could lead to a loss of time, money and reputation with the user and also losing the
contract with the user. Understanding and meeting their needs is the base of the program that I will be making.

---------------------------------------------------------
How do I approach designing software?
---------------------------------------------------------

I like to have the mind set of going in and effectively executing the requirments that are being asked of me while still being caitious of the code that I am writing.
Making sure that everything is follow the SDLC to the best of its abilities and being flexable for any changes that my happen. I think with keeping an open mind and
still looking out for the errors or faults will lead me down the right road in developing.
